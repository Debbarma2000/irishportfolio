I have finally gotten myself to make a website. I have wanted to host a website using jekyll for a long time but always ran away from it thinking its probably very hard. Just today I came across a YouTube video that showed how to make one using a pre-existing theme and I just jumped in. I ran into some major issue as well; jekyll has stopped supporting "relative_permalinks" and this meant I could not use my preferred hyde theme but I did come across this theme and I shall customise it with time. 

I had a website already on google sites but it was very restrictive and also cumbersome if you wish to blog (I have to redirect people to my wordpress website). 

So yeah, that is about it for now. Will try to finish this website as much as possible and leave it for tonight. 

Goodbye!! Have a nice day and thanks for reading.
