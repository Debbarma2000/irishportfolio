## **Current work and interest**

- I am currently reading about _Zero-sum problems in Finite Abelian Groups_ under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Rajendran](https://sites.google.com/view/rvenkateshiisc/home?authuser=0) of maths Department, IISc . Work started from June mid and should continue till August mid formally but most likely continue for the whole year. I am trying to understand the structure of Finite Abelian Groups and find the value of related constants such as the Davenport's constant, Erd√∂s-Ginzberg-Ziv constant, Olson constant. The problem is still open and has very nice connections to other problems especially Non-unique factorisations in finite fields. I shall write a report soon and maybe upload it here if possible.
- I am also reading Introduction to Analytic Number Theory- Tom Apostol by myself. I have recently come across Selberg Sieves and intend to read more about it but before that I need to have the prerequisites right. So I am on it! 

## **Past work**

- In the summer of 2020, I did a reading project under [Prof. B. Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in) . It was on the topic of `Binary Quadratic Forms`. I had solved Niven chapter 1-3 and then wrote a report on Binary Quadratic Forms, their reduction and also tried understanding Zagier's proof of _"Primes of the form 4k+1 as sum of two squares"_ with the help of Binary Quadratic forms, and also read a bit about Gauss class problem. ([report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FuUQM5KR9zPizve3rVtkab-vVhHcP5rD/view?usp=sharing) )
- I also read Topology from M.A. Armstrong's book in summer,2020.

If you wondered how do people typeset those beautiful math papers and books, the answer is LaTeX. An essential tool (not necessary) which will come in handy a lot. You can learn it from [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D4EAB31D3EBC449) and of course google. (Thumb rule: if you want a certain command most likely it is \command, eg: \since, \therefore)
Another essential tool that comes in handy for mathematicians is sagemath which you can learn [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnptel.ac.in%2Fcourses%2F111%2F106%2F111106149%2F&sa=D).

## **Recommendations**

### **Maths**

1. Real Analysis  
    -  Tom Apostol. _Calculus_ Volume - I, II 
    - Ghorpade, Limaye. _A course in Calculus and Real Analysis_ 
    - Ghorpade, Limaye. _A course in Multivariable Calclulus and Analysis_
    - Walter Rudin. _Principle of Mathematical Analysis_
    - Abbott. _Understanding Analysis_
    - Rami Shakarchi. _Problems and Solutions for Undergraduate Analysis_
    - Terence Tao. _Analysis I, II_  
    <span style="color: magenta"> 
     Apostol volumes and/or Ghorpade, Limaye volumes can be used as beginner text. Rudin's book is a classic but might not be very suitable for people who are seeing analysis for the first time.</span>
   
2. Abstract Algebra
    - Joseph Gallian. _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_
    - Dummit and Foote. _Abstract Algebra_  
    <span style="color: magenta"> Gallian would be a nice place to start your journey. Once you are done you can move to Dummit Foote (it covers almost everything) and after that if you continue you will be using books that are dedicated to certain topics anyway.
3. Combinatorics
    - Aigner. _A course in enumeration_
    - Andreescu, Feng. _A Path to Combinatorics for Undergrduates_
    - R.P. Stanley. _Enumerative Combinatorics_  
    <span style="color: magenta"> 
     Aigner's book is a very nice one and can be used independent of others. Otherwise all three of them are very nice.</span>
4. Number Theory
    - D.M. Burton. _Elementary Number Theory_
    - Niven, Montgomery. _Introduction to Theory of Numbers_  
    <span style="color: magenta"> 
    Burton's book is a classic and should be **the** book for beginners. Once you are comfortable with the stuff in Burton you can move to Niven. </span>
5. Topology
    - Munkres. _Topology_
    - M.A. Armstrong. _Basic Topology_
    <span style="color: magenta"> 
     Personally I like Munkres but feel free to read both and choose as you see fit.</span>
6. Linear ALgebra
    - Gilbert Strang. _Linear Algebra and its applications_
    - Hoffman, Kunze. _Linear Algebra_ 
    - Sheldon Axler. _Linear Algebra done right_  
  <span style="color: magenta"> 
     All three books are excellent. Use whatever you like</span>
7. Analytic Number Theory
    - Tom Apostol. _Introduction to Analytic Number Theory_
    - Davenport. _Multiplicative Number Theory_

8. Complex Analysis
    - Conway. _Functions of One Complex Variable_
    - Ahlfors. _Complex Analysis_
    - Shakarchi. _Problems and solutions for Complex Analysis_
9. Measure Theory
    - Royden. _Real Analysis_
    - Folland. _Real Analysis_

10. Functional Analysis
    - Conway. _A course in functional analysis_

11. Algebraic Number Theory
    - Robert Ash. _A Course in Algebraic Number Theory_

12. Representation Theory of finite groups
    - Serre. _Linear Representations of finite groups_ 

13. Commutative Algebra
    - Atiyah. _Introduction to commutative algebra_

### **General**

1. Simon Singh. _Fermat's Last Theorem_
