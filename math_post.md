### Current work and interest

- I am currently reading about zero-sum problems in Finite Abelian Groups under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Rajendran](https://sites.google.com/view/rvenkateshiisc/home?authuser=0) of maths Department, IISc . Work started from June mid and should continue till August mid formally but most likely continue for the whole year. I am trying to understand the structure of Finite Abelian Groups and find the value of related constants such as the Davenport's constant, Erd√∂s-Ginzberg-Ziv constant, Olson constant. The problem is still open and has very nice connections to other problems especially Non-unique factorisations in finite fields. I shall write a report soon and maybe upload it here if possible.
- I am also reading Introduction to Analytic Number Theory- Tom Apostol by myself. I have recently come across Selberg Sieves and intend to read more about it but before that I need to have the prerequisites right. So I am on it! 

### Past work

- In the summer of 2020, I did a reading project under [Prof. B. Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in) . It was on the topic of "Binary Quadratic Forms". I had solved Niven chapter 1-3 and then wrote a report on Binary Quadratic Forms, their reduction and also tried understanding Zagier's proof of "Primes of the form 4k+1 as sum of two squares" with the help of Binary Quadratic forms, and also read a bit about Gauss class problem. ([report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FuUQM5KR9zPizve3rVtkab-vVhHcP5rD/view?usp=sharing) )
- I also read Topology from M.A. Armstrong's book in summer,2020.
