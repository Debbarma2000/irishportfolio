I am Irish Debbarma, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. 

My major is in mathematics and specifically I am interested in 
- Analytic Number Theory
- Combinatorial Number Theory
- Elliptic Curves

Besides this I am also interested in reading about history, geopolitics and related topics. 

I am a regular football player with loyalties to no club. I enjoy cycling and travelling as well.

That is all about me. I would like you all to read this favourite poem of mine before you wander off to other places: 

<div style="font-family: Times New Roman";>

 The Road not taken - by Robert Frost

>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
>
>Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,  
>
>And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  
>
>I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”  
I took the one less traveled by,  
And that has made all the difference.
